    <h2>Task manager</h2>
    <p>Task management is the tool for creating and Managing tasks through the project’s lifecycle.<br>
        It includes gathering requirements, planning, status tracking, testing and creating final reports when tasks are completed.<br>
        Individuals use task management tools like a pen and a pad or software tools to organize and accomplish personal goals for every day’s chores.<br>
        Tasks could have status, start date, due date, people who are assigned to work on them, comments, tags and files which are attached to them.<br>
        I have used AngularJS, NodeJS, MongoDB as for backend.<br>
